QCad Library
===========

This repository is a collecting place of DXF files to be used as library objects in QCad primarily.  As my CAD work focuses primarily on audio system design, that is where the focus of this will be.  Anyone is welcome to utilize this, understand that fonts may not carry through if you do not have the Ubuntu collection of font faces installed on your system.

Additions are more than welcome.  To submit additions, the easiest and quickest way is to fork this on github, and then add your own drawings, and submit a pull request which I will look at and merge into the main branch.  I would ask that as you use this, you make your own work available for others to use and hopefully through the collected efforts of everyone, we can grow this library to allow for quick and easy documentation generation for everyone involved.

Release Announcement:
=====================

(Excerpted from a post to the theatre-sound-list on Google Groups)

I have begun creating a library of 'symbols' for use in signal flow diagrams.  I am probably going to expand it as I need to for my own personal work, but I would imagine at least the generic symbols would be useful to most.  The files are all DXF and are designed to be used in QCad, though any software that reads DXF could probably use them.  Also because I am publishing this on github, I encourage others to participate and submit new files that i can add to the library for other people to use.  Alternatively if you are going to be submitting a fair amount of work, drop me an email and I can see about giving you write privileges if you feel comfortable doing so.

Right now the license for this library is CC-BY-SA 4.0, however I am strongly considering whether BY is appropriate for this type of purpose, so if someone has a compelling argument for me to remove it, I probably will.

Note that the impetus for this is that I just started recreating said library for the third time and wanted a central place to store my work so I don't have to do this to often.  While I am loosely basing all designs off of the suggested USITT Sound Guidelines for signal flow documentation, the standards I have written in to the file with the intention of being printed at 1:10 scale and text still be readable etc.  Full scale would just be a bit ludicrous for these drafts and a bit under 1:10 scale is probably acceptable as well.  All that being said, again I am open to suggestions so if someone has alternatives they can put forth a compelling argument for the 'standard' then I welcome the discussion and am open to change this is literally just works for me.

Obviously, for those that don't know me, I am a strong proponent of open source and open development, and believe this supports that belief, whether or not anyone else joins in I don't have a reason to remove it, and considering there is a free/open-source version of QCad part of my goal is to give a collection of tools for my, and other, students to be able to use without having to unload for a full license to one of the larger suites quite yet.  Frankly I still haven't bought Vectorworks and left Autocad some time back, but for many it will be easier to collaborate in our work if you use Vectorworks etc. and most options of these drafts should still work in that is my understanding.  Again the goal is to keep it as open as possible for anyone to use.
