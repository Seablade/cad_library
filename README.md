QCad Library
===========

This repository is a collecting place of DXF files to be used as library objects in QCad primarily.  As my CAD work focuses primarily on audio system design, that is where the focus of this will be.  Anyone is welcome to utilize this, understand that fonts may not carry through if you do not have the Ubuntu collection of font faces installed on your system.

Additions are more than welcome.  To submit additions, the easiest and quickest way is to fork this on github, and then add your own drawings, and submit a pull request which I will look at and merge into the main branch.  I would ask that as you use this, you make your own work available for others to use and hopefully through the collected efforts of everyone, we can grow this library to allow for quick and easy documentation generation for everyone involved.

I am more than open to discussing expanding or changing the focus of the library, if oyu have suggestions get in touch with me.  Thanks!
